YOURLS Case Insensitive Plugin
==============================

Makes all keywords case insensitive (creates all keywords and calls all keywords lowercase.) Only works if you are using Base 36. Fixes disappearing capital letters.

Installation
------------

Move the `case-insensitive` folder into the `/users/plugins` folder. Then, activate the plugin in the admin interface. That's all there is to it.

Requirements
------------

User must have [YOURLS](http://yourls.org/#Install) 1.5.1+ installed.

Bonus
-----

Works with [YOURLS QR Code Plugin](https://github.com/seandrickson/yourls-qrcode-plugin) to generate smaller QR codes!
